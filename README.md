# AtlasFMTool
A repository to develop a tool to modeling a Feature Model, using FODA, Cardinality-Based and Generative Programming

The Atlas tool goals can be listed as follows:

* To provide a feature modeling environment that will be ideal for educational settings in which students may have little to no experience with SPL practices and may be initially unmotivated regarding the subject;

* To provide a feature model repository that will serve as a database of pre validated example feature models in various notations, presenting various examples of the commonalities and peculiarities of each supported notation;

* To provide a feature modeling environment that is accessible to inexperienced users, possibly from fields other than software engineering or computer science in general, therefore furthering the adoption of SPL practices
by a wider group of practitioners.
