            The present tool has as one of its main purposes the academic bias, in such a way that it is focused to the classroom with the intention of teaching or
            assisting the learning of SPL in Institutions of Higher Education. Through the analysis of SPL modeling tools that were found in the literature, some objectives
            were outlined to fill some gaps that they had, so it is possible to work with their scalability. The following objectives are:
        </p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li class="open">The tool should enable the creation and editing of characteristic models on FODA, Generative Programming and Cardinality-based notations. In addition, it will be possible to convert between such notations.</li>
        <li class="closed">The tool should export and import models from other tools.</li>
        <li class="closed">The tool should allow the creation and correction of tasks by the teachers and sending of tasks by the students.</li>
    </ul>
